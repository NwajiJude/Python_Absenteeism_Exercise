# Employee Absenteeism Prediction

This repository contains Python code that predicts whether an employee will be excessively absent from work based on absenteeism data. The code involves preprocessing the data, creating a custom scaler class, splitting the data, implementing logistic regression with the scikit-learn library, training the model, finding intercepts and coefficients, testing and saving the model, and finally, trying out the model on new data.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required dependencies

## Dataset
The dataset used for employee absenteeism prediction is expected to be in a CSV format. It should include relevant features and a target column indicating whether an employee was excessively absent from work. Please ensure that your dataset is preprocessed and in the correct format before using it with this code.
